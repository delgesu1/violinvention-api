        "instruction": "# **{{INSTRUMENT_UPPER}} LESSON TRANSCRIPT → PRACTICE-READY SUMMARY**\n\n**Role:** You are synthesizing a {{INSTRUMENT}} lesson into its essential teaching. Create a reference that captures the lesson's core transformations while maintaining immediate practical value and all important details.\n\n## **GUIDING PRINCIPLE**\n\nCreate a document that teaches, not just documents. Every element should help a {{MUSICIAN_TERM}} understand and apply the lesson's insights.\n\n## **STUDENT IDENTIFICATION**\n\n**Critical:** Carefully identify the student's name from the transcript. Look for:\n- Greetings and introductions (\"Hi Sarah\", \"Good morning, David\")\n- Direct address during instruction (\"Michael, try this passage again\")\n- Any mention of the student's name in conversation\n- References in scheduling or lesson context\n\nThe student's name, if found, must be included in the \"This Lesson\" section.\n\n---\n\n## **OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n- **Format:** Clean, scannable markdown with strategic white space\n- **Length:** 400-650 words (allow breathing room for clarity)\n- **Structure:** Begin with brief \"This Lesson\" coverage list, then let content reveal its natural organization\n- **Voice:** Direct, active. Preserve teacher's key phrases naturally integrated\n\n---\n\n## **MARKDOWN FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS**\n\n**You MUST format your response using proper markdown syntax:**\n- Use `##` for main section headers (e.g., `## Making the Bow Lead`)\n- Use `###` for subsection headers if needed\n- Use `**text**` for bold emphasis on key concepts\n- Use `*text*` for italic emphasis on subtle points\n- Use `-` for bullet points in lists\n- Use `---` for horizontal rules between major sections if appropriate\n\n---\n\n## **REQUIRED OPENING SECTION**\n\nStart every summary with:\n\n**This Lesson:**\n\n- **If student name identified:** Start with \"Student: [Name]\"\n- List what was worked on (e.g., \"{{WORK_EXAMPLE_1}} — {{WORK_DESCRIPTION_1}}\")\n- Include any exercises, scales, or etudes if covered\n- Add any assignments for next time if mentioned (e.g., \"Next week: Bring {{ASSIGNMENT_EXAMPLE}}\" or \"Prepare {{SCALE_ASSIGNMENT}}\")\n- Keep entries brief and factual—no commentary on quality or focus\n\nFormat examples:\n\n- {{WORK_EXAMPLE_2}}\n- {{SCALE_EXAMPLE}}\n- {{ETUDE_EXAMPLE}}\n- Next lesson: Prepare {{ASSIGNMENT_EXAMPLE_2}}\n\n---\n\n## SYNTHESIS APPROACH**\n\n### **First Pass: Find the Core**\n\nWhat 2-3 transformative concepts dominated this lesson? These become your organizing principles. Look for:\n\n- Moments where understanding shifted\n- Concepts the teacher returned to repeatedly\n- Breakthroughs that unlocked other improvements\n\n### **Second Pass: Let Structure Emerge**\n\nRather than forcing predetermined sections, allow the lesson's natural arc to suggest organization. Consider:\n\n- **What wants to be said first?** Often this is the governing principle or mindset shift\n- **How do concepts naturally cluster?** Group ideas that illuminate each other\n- **What sequence would best serve learning?** Usually: understanding → application → retention\n\n**Section titles should feel inevitable, not categorical.**  Instead of \"{{GENERIC_TECHNIQUE_REFERENCE}},\" write what that technique achieves: \"{{TECHNIQUE_EXAMPLE_1}}\" or \"{{TECHNIQUE_EXAMPLE_2}}.\" Let headers teach, not just label.\n\n### **Writing Principles**\n\n**Hierarchy over exhaustiveness:** Better to fully explain 3 core concepts than list 10 superficially.\n\n**Integration over separation:** If {{TECHNIQUE_LIST}} serve the same expressive goal, discuss them together.\n\n**Essence over inventory:** Include specific {{TECHNICAL_DETAILS}} only when they illuminate a principle or solve a key problem.\n\n**Context over universal rules:** When the teacher addresses specific passages, preserve that specificity. If they say \"make an audible hump here,\" don't extend that to all similar situations unless they explicitly do so. Note when solutions are passage-specific versus general principles.\n\n**Natural language:** Write as if explaining to an intelligent colleague, not filling out a form. Include the teacher's personality—their humor, metaphors, or unique expressions that make concepts memorable.\n\n**Strategic formatting:**\n\n- Use bold/italic for scanning and emphasis\n- Short paragraphs are good; many single sentences are fine (max 3 sentences)\n- Use bullet points when listing genuinely separat**e items, not for continuing thoughts\n\n**Warmth over clinical precision:** Maintain the human teaching relationship. If the teacher used encouraging language or celebrated a breakthrough, let that energy live in the summary.\n\n---\n\n## **QUALITY FILTERS**\n\nBefore finalizing, ask:\n\n1. **Could someone who wasn't at the lesson understand and apply this?**\n2. **Does the document flow naturally from concept to application?**\n3. **Have I preserved the teacher's most memorable/unique language?**\n4. **Is every section genuinely useful in the {{PRACTICE_CONTEXT}}?**\n5. **Have I resisted the urge to include everything?**\n6. **Do the section headers emerge naturally from the content?**\n7. **Does it feel like teaching rather than documentation?**\n\n---\n\n## **WHAT TO EXCLUDE**\n\n- Repetitive explanations of the same concept\n- Generic advice that lacks specificity\n- Assumptions and synthesis that likely isn't true\n- Exhaustive technical details that obscure the main teaching points\n- Filler phrases or transitions that don't add meaning\n\n---\n\n## **SPECIAL CASES**\n\n**Multi-piece lessons:** Find unifying principles; note piece-specific applications inline\n\n**Problem-solving focused:** Lead with the solution discovered, then context\n\n**Philosophy-heavy:** Extract one concrete practice application for each concept\n\n**Breakthrough moments:** When something clicks, capture both what changed and how it felt\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** You're creating a learning tool, not a transcript. Every word should either clarify understanding of the teacher's wisdom and advice. Trust the content to reveal its own best organization. The summary should feel like the lesson's wisdom distilled, not compressed.\n\n## Here is the raw transcript:"

NEVER create tags with placeholder values like \"Not Specified\", \"Unknown\", \"N/A\", or similar. If no student name is found, omit the STUDENT tag entirely.\n\n- **TECHNIQUE:** Identify standard {{INSTRUMENT}} {{PEDAGOGICAL_TERMS}} discussed in the summary. Create SEPARATE tags for each distinct technique. Each tag should be concise, well-recognized by {{INSTRUMENT}} {{EDUCATOR_TERM}}, and map lesson details to established {{TECHNIQUE_TERMINOLOGY}}.\n{{TECHNIQUE_EXAMPLES}}\n\n- **REPERTOIRE:** {{REPERTOIRE_INSTRUCTIONS}}\n{{REPERTOIRE_EXAMPLES}}\n\n# Output Format\nReturn tags in the following format:\nSTUDENT: ActualName\nTECHNIQUE: Technique1\nTECHNIQUE: Technique2\nREPERTOIRE: Piece1\nREPERTOIRE: Composer2\n\n# General Guidelines\n- Keep all tag values concise and clearly stated.\n- Use canonical spelling for composers and repertoire.\n- Limit total tags to 10 per summary.\n- Favor the most significant and frequently discussed lesson elements.\n\n# Post-extraction Validation\nAfter identifying tags, briefly validate that all guidelines and output format requirements are met.
